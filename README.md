# Open Distro Elasticsearch SQL CLI


SQL CLI is a stand alone Python application and can be launched by a wake word `escli`. It serves as a support only for 
[Open Distro SQL plugin for Elasticsearch](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/sql/). You can move 
it around to other machines without having to install Elasticsearch on them.


## Installation

- escli is backward compatible with Python 2.7.
